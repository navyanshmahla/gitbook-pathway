## About the bootcamp

In November 2023, the Web & Coding Club at IIT Bombay and the AI Community at IIT Bombay, supported by the Institute Technical Council, joined hands with Pathway to launch this free, cohort-based course. This initiative, focusing on Generative AI, LLMs, and Real-time Data Processing, addressed the growing need to understand, leverage, and build Generative AI solutions.

**Key highlights:**

* The course was shaped by contributions from global leaders in academia and deep learning, boasting past affiliations with prominent organizations like Google Brain, Mila-Quebec AI Institute, and Microsoft Research.
* The bootcamp attracted over 1400 learners, including over 1000 students from IIT Bombay. Participants included students and professionals from HEC Paris, IIT Delhi, Indiana University, Qualcomm, and Novartis.
* Despite the tight 10-day schedule, the bootcamp inspired active involvement. Various student developers went ahead to create interesting enterprise-centric apps. For example:&#x20;
  * A project management assistant integrated with Slack, capable of delivering real-time insights from Trello Dashboards.
  * An LLM-powered application providing current insights into digital marketing trends influenced by ad spending data.
