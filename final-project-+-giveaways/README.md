# Final Project + Giveaways

#### Welcome to the Final Stretch of Your Bootcamp Journey!&#x20;

As we approach the conclusion of this mini bootcamp, it's time to transform your acquired knowledge into practical applications.&#x20;

To guide you, we've carefully selected a range of exciting project tracks, spotlighting the extensive capabilities of LLM App. These projects are your platform for innovation and making a tangible impact! ðŸŒŸ

### How to Succesfully Complete the Bootcamp

* To qualify for your bootcamp certificate, complete the required MCQsâ€”one in the Vector Embeddings module and another in the RAG module.&#x20;
* Concurrently, you're expected to build a real-time, RAG-based LLM application using the [LLM App](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app). While doing so, you have to make sure to host your open-source project on GitHub Pages and submit its link through the [provided form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeX1MPyUNmkSlnIMZZWurTsQLqFFjM-Gten29Zp1fOJPVEJA/viewform).
* If the idea of creating an LLM application from the ground up (like the one we saw in Amazon Discounts case) feels overwhelming, you have the option to build upon the "Dropbox Chat" example discussed earlier. By tailoring it to meet specific needs, you can construct an application that holds substantial business or social value. For instance, the EU AI Act successfully repurposed the Dropbox Chat framework to simplify the understanding of complex legal documents in the AI domain.
* This being said, there are added incentives (beyond learning) to make a novel application using the LLM App.&#x20;

What are those incentives? Let's read. :star\_struck:
