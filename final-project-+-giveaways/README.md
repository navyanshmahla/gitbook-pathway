# Final Project + Giveaways

#### Welcome to the Final Stretch of Your Bootcamp Journey! ðŸŽ‰

We're nearing the end of this mini bootcamp, and it's time to turn all the learning into action. To help you make the most out of your final project, we've curated a list of exciting tracks that showcase the limitless potential of LLM App. These are not just projects; they're opportunities to innovate and showcase a meaningful impact! ðŸŒŸ

But before we dive into these sample tracks, here's something for everyone:

* **Course Completion**:&#x20;
  * If building from scratch feels daunting, you can complete the course by replicating the "Dropbox Chat" example we demonstrated earlier.&#x20;
  * To earn your bootcamp graduation certificate, build a real-time RAG-based LLM application using LLM App. Furthermore, host your open source project on GitHub, and share with us via [the form](https://forms.gle/wr3asGb9RRgnmBxz6).&#x20;
  * This being said, there are added incentives (beyond learning) to make a novel application using the LLM App. We've shared that ahead.&#x20;
*   **Guidelines for Prizes**:&#x20;

    * Agree to the T\&Cs that are shared on the next page, and remember, each submission must leverage LLM App and its real-time capabilities.&#x20;
    * Exceptional projects will not only receive website showcase but also have a chance to win one of our Top 10 prizes!&#x20;



    What are those? Let's read. :star\_struck:
