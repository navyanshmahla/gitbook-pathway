# Repository Walkthrough

In the particular example, we'll dive a bit deeper to show you how this particular application was made so you can make one of your own.

### Link to the Project

* The repository being referred to can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Boburmirzo/chatgpt-api-python-sales).&#x20;
* If you have a good experience with open source, visiting the above link should enable you to seamlessly build a similar project.&#x20;

### Step by Step Process to Build the Application

A good way to understand the code here would be to read the Streamlit blog below which features the open source application developed by Bobur.&#x20;

It's a friendly and easy to understand blog that also shows how the application interacts with users via an HTTP REST API and works in real-time, offering support for various data types like JSON Lines and Rainforest Product API.
