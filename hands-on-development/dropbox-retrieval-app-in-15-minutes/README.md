# Dropbox Retrieval App in 15 Minutes

Let's dive into the setup and operation of the Dropbox AI Chat tool, an innovative solution that efficiently searches through extensive, unstructured documents stored in your Dropbox using advanced AI capabilities.&#x20;

What you'll be building can be seen below. In this particular showcase we'll be cloning [this particular repository](https://github.com/pathway-labs/dropbox-ai-chat) to enable you to build a similar application quickly.&#x20;

Please note, that this project's aim isn't about focusing on Dropbox or any specific tool.&#x20;

Instead, we're here to explore the world of open-source RAG-based applications, which are impactful and blend seamlessly with many popular tools you're already familiar with. Take inspiration from a learner of this bootcamp cohort, where she integrated real-time data from Trello's board and Slack to create a helpful productivity tool ([GitHub link](https://github.com/leabuende/mike-llm-slack-plugin)).&#x20;

This example illustrates the vast possibilities at your fingertips. In this module, we're offering the starting points to spark your creativity and engineering acumen. ðŸ˜Š
