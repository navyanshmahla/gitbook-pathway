# Course Structure

### Hybrid Approach

Our course is meticulously designed using a hybrid approach. While the core of the content is delivered through recorded sessions, allowing you to learn at your convenience, we've also integrated interactive live sessions. This structure ensures that you get the best of both worlds: the flexibility of self-paced learning and the engagement of real-time discussions.&#x20;

This way, your learning won't interfere with other academic or professional commitments.

### Interactive Sessions

*   **Kick-off Session**:&#x20;

    * Join us on 21st October at 5 p.m. IST / 1:30 p.m. CEST / 4:30 a.m. PDT for our inaugural session. While attending live offers a chance for real-time interaction, we understand schedules might conflict.&#x20;
    * Rest assured, a recording will be emailed to you post-session. Nevertheless, we recommend attending in real time for a more engaging experience. This session will provide an overview of the course essentials, and our dedicated team will be on hand to address any preliminary questions you might have.


* **Fireside Chat with Jan Chorowski and Anup Surendran**:&#x20;
  * On 2nd November, at 6 am PDT / 3 pm CEST / 6:30 pm IST, join us for an enlightening chat with [Anup Surendran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupsurendran/) and [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ\&hl=en). Engage with them through pre-submitted questions via forms (to be shared later), and live chat during the session.
  * In the session, we will delve into topics like:
    * The potentials and boundaries of LLMs.
    * Overcoming challenges in deploying LLM applications.
    * Strategies for building real-time LLM apps.
    * The intriguing concept of "Learning to Forget" in Large Language Models.

Additional office hours or doubt-solving sessions might be organized, depending on the nature and volume of queries received. Our objective is to ensure you receive timely and comprehensive answers.

### Addressing Doubts

* **Self-Reliance**: Our philosophy revolves around nurturing independent learners. While our guidance is continuous, we urge you to harness the expansive knowledge available online, exploring answers through search engines and existing literature.
* **Response Time**: Considering the global footprint of the Pathway team, responses might take up to 24 hours, especially factoring in limited availability on weekends. The AI Community and Web & Coding Club at IIT Bombay, who are actively collaborating closely with Pathway's team, will predominantly address your questions. However, whenever the need arises, Pathway's team is ever-eager to directly assist.
* **Communication Channels**: Ensure you're part of [Pathway's Discord](https://discord.gg/AyEbJbSZ) for such direct interactions. As a best practice, unresolved queries can be raised via GitHub issues and then their link can be shared on Discord.&#x20;

### Quick Checks

* **WhatsApp Community**: If you've shared your contact during registration, you should've been added to a WhatsApp group managed by AI Community IIT Bombay and WnCC IIT Bombay in collaboration with Pathway. If not, please contact [wncc@iitb.ac.in](mailto:wncc@iitb.ac.in) or [mudit+iitb@pathway.com](mailto:mudit+iitb@pathway.com).
* **Email Notifications**: Keep an eye out for an email from [mudit@pathway.com](mailto:mudit@pathway.com) sent on 20th October. Mark it as primary and star it to ensure you never miss out on crucial updates.
* **GitHub Repositories**: It would be fantastic if you could 'Star' :star:  both the linked repositories. This not only keeps you in the loop with our forthcoming updates but also stands as a nod of approval to our work. Your gesture, though small, communicates that you recognize and appreciate the value we're bringing to the table.
