# Course Structure

### Hybrid Approach

Our course is meticulously designed using a hybrid approach. While the core of the content is delivered through recorded sessions, allowing you to learn at your convenience, we've also integrated interactive live sessions. This structure ensures that you get the best of both worlds: the flexibility of self-paced learning and the engagement of real-time discussions.&#x20;

This way, your learning won't interfere with other academic or professional commitments.

### Interactive Sessions

*   **Kick-off Session**:&#x20;

    * The first live session was held on 21st October at 5 p.m. IST / 1:30 p.m. CEST / 4:30 a.m. PDT for our inaugural session. While attending live offered a chance for real-time interaction, we understand schedules might conflict.&#x20;
    * If you couldn't watch the session live, you can find its recording [here](https://youtu.be/AjmeopQuuGI). This session recording will provide an overview of the course essentials.
    * Nevertheless, we recommend attending future events in real-time for a more engaging experience.&#x20;


* **Fireside Chat with Jan Chorowski | Exploring the Frontiers of Large Language Models**:&#x20;
  * On 2nd November, at 6 am PDT / 3 pm CEST / 6:30 pm IST, we hosted an iconic chat around LLMs with [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ\&hl=en) and [Anup Surendran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupsurendran/).&#x20;
  * You can find this session recording after the RAG Module as a Bonus Resource.&#x20;
  * In the session, we will delved into topics like:
    * The potentials and boundaries of LLMs.
    * Overcoming challenges in deploying LLM applications.
    * Strategies for building real-time LLM apps.
    * The intriguing concept of "Learning to Forget" in Large Language Models.

### Addressing Doubts

* **Self-Reliance**: Our philosophy revolves around nurturing independent learners. While our guidance is continuous, we urge you to harness the expansive knowledge available online, exploring answers through search engines and existing literature.
* **Communication Channels**: Ensure you're part of [Pathway's Discord](https://discord.gg/AyEbJbSZ) for asking doubts directly to the creators of the framework we've covered ahead. This being said, please use Google Search, ChatGPT, or other tools at your disposal to try to find the answer yourself. If you're unable to do so, as a best practice, unresolved queries can be raised via GitHub issues and then their link can be shared on Discord.&#x20;

### Bonus Resources & Bonus Modules

* From time-to-time, you'll find Bonus Resources alongside your coursework. These resources are optional and not essential for quizzes or project completion. They're designed to deepen your understanding, complementing the core material which is succinctly crafted for those eager to develop their first real-time LLM application. Feel free to explore these additional materials at your leisure for a broader and more detailed learning experience.
