# Course Structure

### Hybrid Approach

This coursework is meticulously designed using a hybrid approach. While the core of the content is delivered through recorded sessions, allowing you to learn at your convenience, we've also integrated interactive live sessions. This structure ensures that you get the best of both worlds: the flexibility of self-paced learning and the engagement of real-time discussions.&#x20;

This way, your learning won't interfere with other academic or professional commitments.

### Addressing Doubts

* **Self-Reliance**: Our philosophy revolves around nurturing independent learners. While our guidance is continuous, we urge you to harness the expansive online knowledge, exploring answers through search engines and existing literature.
* **Communication Channels**: Ensure you're part of [Pathway's Discord](https://discord.gg/pathway) to ask doubts directly to the framework's creators. This being said, please use Google Search, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or other tools to find the answer yourself. If you're unable to do so, as a best practice, unresolved queries can be raised via GitHub issues, and then their link can be shared on Discord.&#x20;

### Bonus Resources & Bonus Modules

* From time to time, you'll find Bonus Resources alongside your coursework.&#x20;
* These resources are **optional** and not essential for quizzes or project completion. They're designed to deepen your understanding, complementing the core material succinctly crafted for those eager to develop their first real-time LLM application. Feel free to explore these additional materials at your leisure for a broader and more detailed learning experience.
