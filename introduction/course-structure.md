# Course Structure

### Hybrid Approach

This coursework was meticulously designed using a hybrid approach. While the core of the content was delivered through recorded sessions, we also integrated interactive live sessions.&#x20;

Since the bootcamp cohort is now concluded, we've added the session recordings within the coursework for you to watch them at your own pace. :smile:

### Interactive Sessions

*   **Kick-off Session**:&#x20;

    * You can find its recording [here](https://youtu.be/AjmeopQuuGI) if you couldn't watch the session live.
    * &#x20;This session recording will provide an overview of the course essentials.


* **Fireside Chat with Jan Chorowski | Exploring the Frontiers of Large Language Models**:&#x20;
  * You can find the session recording after the RAG Module as a Bonus Resource.&#x20;
  * In the session, we will delve into topics like:
    * The potentials and boundaries of LLMs.
    * Overcoming challenges in deploying LLM applications.
    * Strategies for building real-time LLM apps.
    * The intriguing concept of "Learning to Forget" in Large Language Models.

### Addressing Doubts

* **Self-Reliance**: Our philosophy revolves around nurturing independent learners. While our guidance is continuous, we urge you to harness the expansive online knowledge, exploring answers through search engines and existing literature.
* **Communication Channels**: Ensure you're part of [Pathway's Discord](https://discord.gg/pathway) to ask doubts directly to the framework's creators. This being said, please use Google Search, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or other tools to find the answer yourself. If you're unable to do so, as a best practice, unresolved queries can be raised via GitHub issues, and then their link can be shared on Discord.&#x20;

### Bonus Resources & Bonus Modules

* From time to time, you'll find Bonus Resources alongside your coursework.&#x20;
* These resources are **optional** and not essential for quizzes or project completion. They're designed to deepen your understanding, complementing the core material succinctly crafted for those eager to develop their first real-time LLM application. Feel free to explore these additional materials at your leisure for a broader and more detailed learning experience.
