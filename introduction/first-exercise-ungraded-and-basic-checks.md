# First Exercise (Ungraded) and Basic Checks

## First Set of To-Dos

To make this course interactive and engaging, let's get started with a small exercise. This is a mandatory exercise to enable you to make the best use of this course.

*   **Star the GitHub Repo**:&#x20;

    * Visit the [Pathway](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway) and the [LLM App GitHub repository](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app) and give it a star.&#x20;
    * Doing so will not only show your support but also keep you updated as the project evolves. As an ideal practice, youâ€™ll be recommended to ask your queries via GitHub issues on the repo.&#x20;


* **Join** [**Pathwayâ€™s Discord**](https://discord.gg/SzSHw8Hd) **community:**&#x20;
  * Join your peers and mentors as we embark on this short yet exciting learning journey. We encourage you to introduce yourself in the #introductions channel, fostering a more personalized community experience. With the presence of some of the world's leading AI and Data researchers, you're in good company.
  * Additionally, as a best practice, we advocate for active participation in open-source communities like that of Pathway. Engaging proactively not only accelerates your learning but also opens doors to valuable connections and collaborations.&#x20;
  * When introducing yourself, consider sharing any prior engagements in Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, or Academic Research. For those just beginning, feel free to discuss your existing background and how you aim to harness the potential of real-time LLMs. ðŸ˜Š
