# Pre-Requisites

With this bootcamp, our primary aim is to equip you with the skills needed to:

* Create your own LLM application using open-source technologies built for production
* Understand the architecture of an LLM
* Grasp various stages of the LLM pipeline
* Master the fundamentals of prompt engineering
* Leverage the power of open source and large language models to build meaningful solutions that solve problems.

### Pre-Requisites

**Python Foundations**: If you're new to Python or need a refresher, here are some free Python tutorials to get you started.

**Open Source Familiarity:** While previous experience with open-source projects can be beneficial, it isn't essential. It's worth noting that many routine challenges, such as publishing a local project on GitHub or using widely-accepted APIs, can often be resolved through a simple Google search or by consulting the relevant documentation. While these challenges won't present themselves at every turn, independently navigating them will equip you with the skills to devise impactful solutions in the future.
