# Pre-Requisites

Our primary aim is to equip you with the skills needed to:

* Create your own LLM application using open-source technologies
* Understand the architecture of an LLM
* Grasp various stages of the LLM pipeline
* Master the fundamentals of prompt engineering
* Leverage the power of open source and large language models to build meaningful solutions that solve problems.

### Pre-Requisites

**Python Foundations**: If you're new to Python or need a refresher, here are some free Python tutorials to get you started.

* [https://www.py4e.com/](https://www.py4e.com/)

**Docker Fundamentals:** Docker is great in resolving the "it works on my machine" issue. Hence it's great not just for this bootcamp but for enabling you to explore open source frameworks in general. Here are a couple of resources you can consider:&#x20;

* [How to Dockerize your Python Applications](https://youtu.be/0UG2x2iWerk)

**Open Source Familiarity:** While previous experience with open-source projects can be beneficial, it isn't essential. It's worth noting that many routine challenges, such as publishing a local project on GitHub or using widely-accepted APIs, can often be resolved through a simple Google search or by consulting the relevant documentation. While these challenges won't present themselves at every turn, independently navigating them will equip you with the skills to devise impactful solutions in the future.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

* Be proficient in developing LLM-based applications for production applications from day 0.
* Have a clear understanding of LLM architecture and pipeline.
* Be able to perform prompt engineering to make the best use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.
* Create an open-source project on a real-time stream of data or static data.
