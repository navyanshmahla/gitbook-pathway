# Prerequisites

This bootcamp is tailored to accommodate participants with minimal prerequisites, ensuring it's approachable for individuals from various backgrounds. For those in business functions or educational domains outside of programming, the course's theoretical aspects are still largely comprehensible. This understanding will aid in making more informed decisions and better use of these technologies.&#x20;

However, having a grasp of the listed prerequisites will greatly facilitate your journey through the entire curriculum, including bonus resources and the hands-on development module.

**1 – Python Foundations**: If you're new to Python or need a refresher, here are some free Python tutorials to get you started.

**3 – Open Source Familiarity:** While previous experience with open-source projects can be beneficial, it isn't essential. It's worth noting that many routine challenges, such as publishing a local project on GitHub or using widely-accepted APIs, can often be resolved through a simple Google search or by consulting the relevant documentation. While these challenges won't present themselves at every turn, independently navigating them will equip you with the skills to devise impactful solutions in the future.
