# Getting Started

This course is meticulously crafted for beginners who are grounded in programming, especially with a forte in Python. Prior expertise in LLMs or generative AI is not necessary, as our curriculum ensures a progressive learning experience.

### Kick-off Session Recording (Optional)&#x20;

If you couldn't attend the kick-off session of the bootcamp live, you have the option to watch the 30-minute recorded interaction below.&#x20;

However, reading the course introduction is highly recommended. If you prefer, you can first read the course introduction and then return to the kick-off session's video if you have any questions or need further clarification.&#x20;

### Course Progression

* **Starting with the Basics**: Our journey commences by laying the foundational bedrock of Large Language Models and Generative AI.
* **Intermediate Exploration**: As we navigate deeper waters, we touch upon essential components like vector indices, word vectors, and the intricate art of prompt engineering.
* **Advanced Insights**: The final stretch of our curriculum focuses on in-depth topics such as RAG, LLM Architecture, LLM Pipelines, and hands-on development exercises.

**Note:** We'll be releasing modules gradually during the bootcamp. You'll be notified when they're released.

### The power of Real-time Data and Large Language Models

A pivotal theme of this course is the amalgamation of real-time data with Large Language Models. Harnessing this synergy can lead to transformative solutions addressing pressing societal and business challenges. While you will pretty much be able to build custom LLM Apps for static data sources as well, our chosen open-source framework effortlessly supports both real-time ("Streaming") and static ("Batch") data with a small change in a Python code.

In our digital age, the fusion of immediate data with LLMs is transformative. It accelerates processes, from financial transactions to healthcare responses. Think about it: a financial transaction that once took days can now be executed in mere milliseconds, a testament to the immense power of real-time data. By integrating real-time data streams with LLMs, we can develop applications that not only respond promptly but also have the potential to drive meaningful impacts for humanity. And that's pretty much one of the key goals of this course.

### Course Intensity

The course is structured to span a concise 7 days of focused learning, followed by 3 days dedicated to hands-on building. While the difficulty level is moderated to accommodate this timeline, supplementary reference materials are integrated for those eager to delve deeper.

### Learning Beyond the Curriculum

To enrich your learning experience, we've scheduled an insightful session with deep learning reference figure, [Jan Chorowski](https://pathway.com/our-story/#jan-chorowski). This ensures a comprehensive learning journey, equipping you with a spectrum of knowledge, irrespective of your starting point.

### Your Role as a Learner

While we lay the groundwork and provide the tools, the epicentre of learning and exploration resides with you. We set the stage, but the performance‚Äîthe application, the innovation, the breakthroughs‚Äîdepends on your initiative and drive.

As we chart this transformative journey, are you poised to harness the untapped potentials of LLMs combined with real-time data for the greater good? Let's embark on this venture together! üöÄ

### Get to Know Pathway ‚Äì our collaborators for this course

Pathway is the world's fastest data processing engine supporting unified workflows for batch, streaming data, and LLM applications.&#x20;

Pathway is the single, fastest integrated data processing layer for real-time intelligence.

* Mix-and-match: batch, streaming, API calls including LLMs.
* Effortless transition from batch to real-time - just like setting a flag in your Spark code.
* Powered by an extremely efficient and scalable Rust engine, reducing costs of any computations.
* Enabling use cases enterprises were craving, making advanced data transformations lightning-fast and easy to implement.

### Why is Pathway so Fast <a href="#why-is-pathway-so-fast" id="why-is-pathway-so-fast"></a>

The Pathway engine is built in Rust. We love Rust ü¶Ä. Rust is built for speed, parallel computation and low-level control over hardware resources. This allows us to execute maximum optimization for performance and speed.

We also love Python üêç. Which is the makers of Pathway made in a way that when you write your data processing code in Python, Pathway will automagically compile it into a Rust dataflow. In other words, using Pathway you don‚Äôt need to know anything about Rust to enjoy its enormous performance benefits! For now, this is a simple enough starting point (that said, feel free to find more details in Pathway's [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13116) ‚Äì your first bonus resource üôÇ).
