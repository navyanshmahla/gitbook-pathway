# Tasks in the Excercise

**Subtask 1: Plot Extension**

Design a prompt to generate a continuation of the mystery story that uncovers another layer of the hacking plot. Perhaps Valérie finds out there's a mole in her organization, or maybe Sophie encounters another similar case. Craft a prompt that nudges the story into revealing this new dimension. Evaluate how seamlessly the new narrative fits with the original story.



**Subtask 2: Few-Shot Prompting for Character Analysis**

Utilize a few-shot prompt that instructs ChatGPT to analyze the main characters' emotional states at crucial points in the story. For instance, ask the model to perform sentiment analysis on Valérie when she discovers the hacking, and Sophie when she finally solves the case. Note the efficacy of few-shot prompting in eliciting nuanced character analysis.



**Subtask 3: Limitation Recognition due to Outdated Data**

Pose a question about the use of AI and machine learning algorithms in contemporary eSports as depicted in the story, asking for the latest advancements as of 2023. Evaluate ChatGPT's response for potential inaccuracies or outdated information given its last training data is from April 2023 (this date is certainly expected to change from time-to-time). Discuss how this limitation affects the believability of the plot and the technological aspects described in the story.



For each subtask, provide the prompt you used, summarize the response, and give a thorough analysis of how well ChatGPT performed in terms of context, plot coherency, and technological accuracy.
