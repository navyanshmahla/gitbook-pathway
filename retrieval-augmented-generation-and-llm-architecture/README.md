# Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLM Architecture

Welcome to the fascinating world of LLM Architecture and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, commonly known as RAG.&#x20;

In the current landscape, the value of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the progression of content understanding and generation is widely acknowledged. However, LLMs come with limitations such as the production of incorrect information, lack of data source verification, and dependence on outdated data. These shortcomings are particularly consequential for businesses that prioritize real-time, precise, and auditable dataâ€”commonly identified as key concerns.

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** offers a transformative solution to these issues. It elevates the capabilities of LLMs, making them relevant, reliable, and up-to-date.

In this module, we're laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration of specialized techniques to improve pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for particular use cases.&#x20;

Let's start by understanding

* What RAG is and
* Why it's a crucial component in the LLM ecosystem.
