# Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLM Architecture

Welcome to the fascinating world of LLM Architecture and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, commonly known as RAG. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a transformative solution to these issues. It elevates the capabilities of LLMs, making them relevant, reliable, and up-to-date.

In this module, we're laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration of specialized techniques to improve pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for particular use cases. Let's start by understanding what RAG is and why it's such a crucial component in the LLM ecosystem.
